# Social Media API with Express and Node.js
This project is a RESTful API for a social media platform built using Express and Node.js. The API is designed to handle user authentication and manage user data, including blogs section. The API can be used to create a social media platform, or it can be integrated into an existing platform to add social media functionality.
## Features
The Social Media API includes the following features:

* User authentication with password hashing.
* CRUD operations for managing user data, including blogs section.
* Error handling and validation for ensuring data integrity and security.
* Integration with a MongoDB database for storing user data.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Social Media API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the application with `npm start`.
4. The API should now be accessible through `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
To use the Social Media API, follow these steps:

1. Create a new user by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` with a JSON payload containing the user data.
2. Log in to the API by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/login` with a JSON payload containing the user credentials. The API will return a token that can be used to authenticate future requests.
3. Send requests to the API to manage user data, including creating, updating, and deleting posts, comments, likes, and followers. The API supports standard HTTP methods for these operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).
4. Log out of the API by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/logout`.
